I chose to take this course because I thought it would be very applicable. I also
want to learn how to use my computer and other operating systems to there greatest 
extent I don't want to be a surface level user of a computer. I want to be able 
to create scripts and shortcuts and knowledge of the computer that will make my
everyday use of it more efficient. I also think that linux is a very baseline
and good to know for understand how a computer works without all the GUI's that
windows and mac use. This class also seemed like a fun class and I enjoyed the 
last class that I had with professor Mark Erle. These are also a bunch of things
that I want to understand so that when I go out into the work force I am not just
bewildered by the words that they are using when they are talking about the systems.
And I will be able to keep us with how to use the systems and get a more general
understanding of systems themselves.
