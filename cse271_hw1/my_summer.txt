This summer I worked alot and I also played alot of golf. I worked for a company
called maverick lite which does lighting designs and lighting controls for 
residential housings. This isn't directly related to CS but the things that I was
doing for the company were all CS related. Meaning making scripts to speed up 
work flow. Alot of the AutoLisp and python was used this year to make all these 
scripts that the company now uses every day.
